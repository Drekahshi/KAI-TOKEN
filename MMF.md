As blockchain technology continues to reshape global finance, its application in creating accessible savings tools for underbanked populations in Africa is increasingly relevant. A promising opportunity lies in developing a Money Market Fund (MMF) on the CORE blockchain that allows users, particularly in Kenya, to invest in and earn yield from BTC and CORE while preserving capital. The proposed framework combines DeFi infrastructure, local currency integration, smart contract automation, and user-focused design.

At its core, an MMF is a financial product that pools user funds and allocates them into low-risk, liquid yield-bearing instruments. In the blockchain space, this concept can be tokenized and decentralized, enabling investors to earn passive income from assets like Bitcoin and CORE without needing technical or trading expertise. The protocol would tokenize user deposits into yield-bearing tokens (e.g., MMF-K) and allocate funds into BTC and CORE strategies, such as BTC lending, liquid staking, or stablecoin minting.

A key innovation in this model is allowing investors to deposit in Kenyan Shillings (KSH) via mobile money platforms like M-PESA. These funds are on-ramped into crypto (e.g., USDT or CORE) and then allocated to the MMF. The system splits each deposit into two distinct parts: an emergency fund (20%) and a locked savings pool (80%). This dual-pool architecture ensures users have some liquidity while still committing most of their funds for yield.

The emergency fund portion remains liquid and available for immediate withdrawal, providing flexibility for unplanned expenses. It earns minimal or no interest but offers fast access and peace of mind. The locked fund, on the other hand, is held in smart contracts for a minimum of 7 days, during which it accrues higher yield from BTC and CORE-based strategies. Withdrawals before the lock-up period are restricted, instilling saving discipline while protecting the fund’s long-term sustainability.

This system would be built using Solidity-based smart contracts compatible with the CORE blockchain. The deposit and withdrawal logic includes time tracking, yield calculations, and capital allocation, with safeguards to prevent premature withdrawals. Users interact with the platform via a mobile-first application tailored to African contexts, with support for local languages, live KSH valuations, and simple interfaces.

For added inclusivity, agent-based onboarding or USSD integration can support users with basic phones. Additionally, tools like Chainlink oracles and smart auditing can ensure transparency, safety, and interest rate accuracy.

Ultimately, this MMF design addresses key challenges African users face—access, trust, and utility—by combining familiar financial behaviors (like savings and emergency funds) with advanced DeFi tools. It empowers users to save in BTC and CORE, earn passive income, and still access funds when needed, all while bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 through localized and practical innovation.



The KAI Chain Money Market Fund (KAI MMF) is a groundbreaking decentralized saving and investing platform designed to meet the unique financial needs of African users, especially in Kenya. Built on the CORE blockchain, its primary goal is to enable users to gain secure and rewarding exposure to BTC and CORE through structured saving products. Unlike typical DeFi products that prioritize speculation, KAI MMF emphasizes disciplined savings, reward-backed lockups, and flexible liquidity—bridging the gap between financial inclusion and crypto-powered opportunity.

At the heart of the KAI MMF framework lies user freedom. When users deposit funds—whether through mobile money (e.g., M-PESA), CORE, BTC, or stablecoins—they are given full control over how their funds are treated. Rather than splitting deposits automatically, users choose their own lock-up duration based on personal goals. The core saving product is built around fixed lock periods starting at 30 days, rewarding long-term commitment with higher annual percentage yields (APYs). Daily rewards are calculated and visible in real-time, but they remain locked until the full lock-up term is completed. This encourages patience while maintaining transparency.

A standout feature of KAI MMF is its flexible liquidity design. Although users are encouraged to complete their chosen lock period, they are not penalized with capital loss if they withdraw early. Instead, a portion—or all—of their rewards is slashed based on how early the withdrawal occurs. This ensures users maintain access to their funds while preserving the integrity of the saving discipline model.

KAI MMF also introduces credit eligibility through commitment. Users who lock at least KES 5,000 for 90 days become eligible for credit facilities. These loans are collateralized by the user’s locked savings, with terms (amount and interest rate) determined by both the lock-up amount and duration. In case of default, the system simply recovers funds from the collateralized balance—creating a trustless and automated lending ecosystem. This approach enables access to responsible credit without the need for paperwork, guarantors, or bureaucracy.

Users earn their rewards in an ecosystem-native, CORE-backed stablecoin, preserving purchasing power while ensuring seamless on-chain utility. At withdrawal, users can choose to redeem their savings or interest in BTC, CORE, the stablecoin itself, or even mobile money—making the system locally relevant and globally connected.

Beyond individual savers, KAI MMF supports group-based saving circles (chamas). Communities can pool funds into shared investment vaults, build trust collectively, and access higher returns or group-based credit tools. This feature anchors KAI MMF in the African culture of collective saving and mutual support.

KAI MMF isn’t just another DeFi product—it’s a hybrid financial model tailored for African realities. It merges the power of decentralized finance with the familiarity of local financial behaviors. It rewards consistency, offers liquidity, empowers borrowing, and brings BTC and CORE within reach of everyday savers. As KAI evolves, future flexibility will allow users to customize buckets, shift between pools, and manage capital dynamically. This is not only a blueprint for KAI MMF—but a prototype for the future of financial sovereignty in Africa.
