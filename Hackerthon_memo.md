# On-Chain Evolving NFT Game

Design a fully on-chain, interactive NFT game built on Core Blockchain — where NFTs evolve over time based on user actions. Combining elements of randomness, progression, and user care, the game should offer an engaging experience with dynamic metadata, gameplay mechanics, and marketplace integration.

## Overview
- Gamified NFT experience: NFTs are evolving digital entities.
- Users interact with NFTs, influence attributes, and trade based on behavior-driven rarity and utility.

## Challenge
Participants will build a platform that enables users to:
- **Mint or acquire unique NFTs** with randomized traits and evolving visuals.
- **Interact with NFTs** (training, upgrading, care), with all data tracked on-chain.
- **Influence NFT evolution, stats, and rarity** through engagement or strategic gameplay.
- **Combine or "merge" NFTs** to generate new ones with inherited traits.
- **Trade NFTs** on an integrated or third-party marketplace, with evolution history affecting value.

## Smart Contract Requirements
- **NFT Lifecycle Management:** Full ownership, transfer, and metadata updates on-chain.
- **Dynamic Metadata Engine:** Track and reflect traits (level, age, condition, mood) in real time.
- **Evolution Mechanics:** Change visuals and stats based on user interaction and progression logic.
- **Merging/Breeding System:** Trait inheritance from two NFTs, with cooldowns and supply controls.
- **Interaction Constraints:** Daily limits, cooldowns, and event-based mechanics.

## Platform Features
- Interactive UI
- Wallet Support
- NFT Profiles
- Marketplace Integration
- Visual Renderer
- Reward System
