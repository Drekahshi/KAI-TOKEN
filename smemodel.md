# KAI x Mastercard SME Infrastructure & Credit Enablement Partnership

## 🤝 Partnership Proposal

**Objective:**
To transform African SMEs into digitally empowered, credit-eligible economic units by integrating Mastercard’s infrastructure with KAI’s DeFi ecosystem. This collaboration will eliminate transactional friction, enable tokenized asset creation (via TaaS), and unlock access to credit using real-time business data rather than traditional collateral.

3. **Provide Credit Access** via algorithmic scoring and DeFi lending pools
4. **Reduce Cost of Digitization** with plug-and-play tools and USSD-compatible wallets
5. **Enhance SME Trustworthiness** using verified reputational tokens
