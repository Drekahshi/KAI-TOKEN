lstBTC Vault

A yield vault where wrapped BTC (wBTC) and LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) are converted into lstBTC at the underlying custodian, allowing users to earn yield while maintaining the benefits of liquidity staking.

Key Features
Wrapped BTC and LST Integration: Users deposit wBTC and LSTs into the vault, which are then converted into lstBTC at the custodian.
Yield Generation: The lstBTC earned within the vault generates yield, combining the benefits of liquid staking with BTC exposure.
Custodian-Based Conversion: The conversion process happens through a trusted custodian, ensuring security and transparency.
Liquidity and Flexibility: Users can withdraw or convert lstBTC back to wBTC and LSTs, ensuring liquidity and flexibility within the vault.
Enhanced Yield Efficiency: By leveraging both BTC and LSTs, the vault provides an efficient method to earn yield without compromising the underlying assets' value.


BTC Collateral Lock & USDT Loan System on Core

Create a decentralized platform on Core that allows users to lock their BTC on Bitcoin L1 and receive a USDT loan on Core, similar to Lava.xyz. This system enables users to leverage BTC without selling it, offering a secure and efficient collateralized lending solution.

Key Features
BTC Collateral Locking: Users lock BTC on Bitcoin L1 as collateral, secured and validated by Core.
USDT Loan on Core: Users receive USDT loans based on the BTC collateral, with a loan-to-value ratio to ensure proper borrowing.
Secure and Transparent: Smart contracts manage collateral securely, with trusted oracles verifying the BTC value in real-time.
Automatic Liquidation: Collateral is automatically liquidated if the BTC value drops significantly or the loan is not repaid.
Interest Rates and Loan Terms: Competitive interest rates based on market conditions, with clear repayment terms and penalties.
Core Ecosystem Integration: Full integration with Core’s decentralized infrastructure for easy BTC locking and loan management.

Yield Tokenization AMM/Protocol

Objective
Emulate Pendle / Spectra Yield Tokenization, creating a permissionless protocol that tokenizes yield-bearing assets (such as stCORE, lstBTC, dualCORE) into standardized yield tokens (SY). These SY tokens are then split into their principal token (PT) and yield token (YT), allowing users to execute advanced yield strategies.

Description:
This protocol enables the creation of wrapped yield-bearing tokens, such as SY-stCORE, that are compatible with Automated Market Makers (AMMs). The tokenization process divides the SY token into:

PT (Principal Token): Represents the underlying asset.
YT (Yield Token): Represents the yield generated from the underlying asset.
Yield Tokenization allows users to engage in the following advanced yield strategies:

Fixed Yield: Earn a fixed yield on tokens like stCORE, lstBTC, and dualCORE.
Long/Short Yield: Bet on the yield of tokens (e.g., long or short lstBTC yield).
Earn More Yield Without Additional Risk: Provide liquidity using assets like stCORE, lstBTC, and dualCORE to earn more yield, while separating principal and yield.
Strategy Mix: Combine these strategies for customized approaches to yield farming.




Intent-Centric dApps

Create intent-centric dApps that simplify DeFi onboarding by reducing the steps for users, guiding them to the best options based on their goals (e.g., maximizing yield).

Description
Intent-centric dApps streamline the DeFi process by understanding the user’s goal and presenting the best options with minimal effort, eliminating the need for multiple steps or platforms.

Example Use Case:
If a user wants the best yield for CORE, the dApp shows them APY options for different staking methods (e.g., stCORE, B14G dual staking, Pell) and lets them stake with one click.
Key Features
Intent Detection: Identifies user goals (e.g., best yield, secure staking) with minimal input.
APY Comparison: Compares APYs across DeFi protocols and validators.
1-Click Staking: Easy, one-click participation in the best option.
Seamless UX: Simple onboarding and minimal friction for users.
Cross-Protocol Integration: Supports multiple DeFi platforms for flexible yield options.



Fluid Fork – Unified Liquidity Layer with Lending, Borrowing, and DEX

Objective/Goal
Develop a fork of the Fluid protocol on Core Blockchain, leveraging a single liquidity layer that powers multiple DeFi components—Lending, Borrowing, DEX, Vaults, and Liquid Staking. The goal is to create a capital-efficient, composable, and scalable DeFi platform where assets are pooled into one unified system rather than siloed liquidity pools. This enhances yield opportunities for liquidity providers and offers users seamless interaction between lending, borrowing, and trading.

Challenge Description
Design and implement a DeFi protocol on Core Blockchain that allows users to:

Deposit assets into a shared liquidity layer to earn yield across multiple use cases.
Borrow assets against overcollateralized positions from the same liquidity pool.
Trade assets directly through an integrated AMM-style DEX, powered by the same underlying capital.
Automatically rebalance liquidity to maximize capital efficiency across components (e.g., routing idle lending liquidity into DEX or staking).
Smart Contracts Must
Manage a unified liquidity pool that dynamically allocates liquidity between lending markets, vault strategies, and trading pairs.
Track user positions across lending, borrowing, and DEX activities using a unified accounting layer.
Automatically adjust interest rates and liquidity incentives based on market utilization and risk profiles.
Implement dynamic collateral management and liquidation mechanisms for undercollateralized borrowers.
Enable zero-slippage trading on deep liquidity pairs and offer optimal routing for volatile/low-liquidity assets.
Incorporate a vault strategy system where idle capital can be used in low-risk yield strategies (e.g., liquid staking or yield farming).
The Platform Should Include
Unified Dashboard: A single user interface where users can manage deposits, loans, swaps, and vault allocations.
Wallet Integration: Native support for Core-compatible wallets with streamlined transaction batching and gas efficiency.
Multi-Asset Collateral System: Users should be able to collateralize multiple asset types with real-time health factor tracking.
Risk Engine: An on-chain system that evaluates liquidity depth, volatility, and utilization to dynamically manage LTV ratios and interest rates.
DEX Aggregator & AMM: Native AMM integration plus routing through external Core-based DEXs if beneficial to the user.
Oracle Integration: Use decentralized oracles to maintain up-to-date prices for all supported assets.
Modular Governance: Token-based governance for adjusting protocol parameters (interest curves, liquidation penalties, listing new assets).

OnlyFans-style SocialFi Platform

Create a SocialFi platform where each user has a personalized token or ticket associated with their account. These tokens can be traded, and tickets grant access to content creators, that can include both real individuals and virtual AI avatars (like VTubers), managed by teams.

Key Features
Personalized Tokens/Tickets: Each user (content creator or fan) has their own tradable token or ticket that can be bought, sold, or transferred.
Access to Content: Tickets can be used to unlock access to exclusive content, such as virtual meetups, livestreams, or private content from creators (including both real and virtual AI avatars).

ShameFi/AttentionFi Platform


Create a ShameFi/AttentionFi platform like waifu where individuals who sell a significant portion of their presale tokens (e.g., 25% or more) are penalized by being blocked from all future airdrops. This platform will allow anyone to add their core token to be tracked for presale sales and airdrop eligibility.

Key Features
Presale Penalties: Users who sell 25% or more of their presale tokens will be flagged and blocked from future airdrops, creating a disincentive for early sell-offs.
Token Tracking: Allow any project or individual to add their core token to the platform, enabling tracking of presale sales and preventing airdrop eligibility for those who violate the rules.
Airdrop Management: Track and manage airdrops for eligible users, ensuring that only those who haven’t violated presale sale limits are eligible.
Transparency: Clear guidelines on presale sales, penalties, and airdrop eligibility for users to follow.
