ðŸŸ£ 1. Executive Summary (1 page)
Briefly state:

The problem: Most Africans lack access to affordable, reliable pensions.

The solution: KAI Pension â€“ a universal, trust-automated, AI-driven, token-based pension protocol.

What makes it different: Interoperable, programmable inheritance, low entry barrier, rewards, multi-platform access.

Focus on:

Pension inaccessibility for informal workers (majority of Africans)

Broken systems (e.g., NSSF underperformance, lack of trust in insurers)

Annual payment strain

Lack of financial education

Gender gaps, youth exclusion

No digital or programmable inheritance systems
